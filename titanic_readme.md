## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to understand the factors that influenced survival during the 1912 disaster. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling, we identify key patterns and build predictive models.

**Main Goals:**
- Perform thorough exploratory data analysis
- Identify factors that influenced passenger survival
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models
- Provide actionable insights about survival patterns

## üìä Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers with the following features:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| PassengerId | Unique passenger identifier | Numeric |
| Survived | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) | Binary |
| Pclass | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) | Categorical |
| Name | Passenger name | Text |
| Sex | Gender (male/female) | Categorical |
| Age | Age in years | Numeric |
| SibSp | Number of siblings/spouses aboard | Numeric |
| Parch | Number of parents/children aboard | Numeric |
| Ticket | Ticket number | Text |
| Fare | Passenger fare | Numeric |
| Cabin | Cabin number | Text |
| Embarked | Port of embarkation (C/Q/S) | Categorical |

## üîç Key Findings

### Survival Statistics
- **Overall survival rate: 38%** (342 survived out of 891 passengers)
- **Gender impact:** Females had 74% survival rate vs. males at 19%
- **Class impact:** 1st class (63%) > 2nd class (47%) > 3rd class (24%)

### Critical Factors for Survival

1. **Gender** - Most important factor
   - "Women and children first" policy was clearly implemented
   
2. **Passenger Class & Fare** 
   - Higher class passengers had better access to lifeboats
   - Strong correlation between fare paid and survival chances
   
3. **Age**
   - Children under 16 had higher survival rates
   - Elderly passengers had lower survival rates
   
4. **Family Size**
   - Passengers with 1-2 family members had optimal survival
   - Large families (5+) and solo travelers had lower survival
   
5. **Port of Embarkation**
   - Cherbourg (C): 55% survival rate
   - Queenstown (Q): 39% survival rate  
   - Southampton (S): 33% survival rate

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values:** 
  - Age: Filled with median (robust to outliers)
  - Embarked: Dropped 2 rows with missing values
  - Cabin: Dropped entire column (77% missing)
- **Data Types:** Converted categorical variables for memory efficiency
- **Duplicates:** Verified no duplicate records exist

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of each feature individually
- Identified data skewness and outliers
- Assessed class imbalances

#### Bivariate Analysis  
- Survival rates across different categories
- Box plots for continuous variables vs survival
- Cross-tabulation analysis

#### Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation matrix of numeric features
- Combined effect of multiple features on survival
- Feature interaction analysis

### 3. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Models Tested:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Cross-Validation (5-fold)

## üìà Results

### Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | Cross-Val Mean |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Random Forest | ~82-84% | ~81% |
| Logistic Regression | ~78-80% | ~79% |
| Decision Tree | ~75-77% | ~76% |

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)
1. **Sex** - Most predictive feature
2. **Fare** - Strong predictor of survival
3. **Age** - Moderate importance  
4. **Pclass** - Important class indicator
5. **Family Size** - Minor but useful predictor
